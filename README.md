# OsuPlugin

A Minecraft (Spigot) plugin to interact with osu! API. Currently written and tested on 1.12.2 but should work on any version within reason.

## Commands

Here is the current commandset:

- /beatmapset <id> - Gives a book providing you with info + all the difficulties of a given set ID
- /beatmap <id> - Gives a book providing you with info on a given map ID

## TODO

The idea is to support basically anything the osu! API supports, but only the above commands are currently supported.
